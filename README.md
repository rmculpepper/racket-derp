# Parsing with derivatives

This repository contains a modified version of the original derp (DERivative Parser) code from

  http://www.ucombinator.org/projects/parsing/

specifically, from

  http://www.ucombinator.org/projects/parsing/derp-latest.tar.gz (retrieved 2020-08-01).

That source bundle does not contain an explicit license, so the licensing status is unclear.
